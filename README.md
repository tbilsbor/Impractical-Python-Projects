# Impractical Python Projects

I'm working through the book Impractical Python Projects by Lee Vaughan

My general approach is to read the objectives and work on the problem myself without reading further
If I get stuck, I look at the strategy and the pseudocode
After I've got a working solution, I look at the book's code to see how they did it
If I type in the book's code myself in order to learn it better, I'll append that file with \_book

All the book's code is publicly available at
